## Challenges and Room for Improvement
This was not the first time I have used REST apis before in a project, but it still posed a challenge to me. The very first aspect I worked on was the api call which I used axios to greatly simplify the process for. The biggest challenge for me was making the burger menu responsive and look correct. During this project I tried using a more component based architecture than my previous sites, which helped simplify the development process and made the site much easier to work on. If I could do anything differently, it would be to take my time with each component before moving onto the next so I would'nt have to jump back and forth between files to fix issues.
